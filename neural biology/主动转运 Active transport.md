Transport of molecules against their concentration gradient using **membrane proteins + energy**


### 原发性主动转运 Primary Active Transport 

- **Energy Source**: Direct use of metabolic energy (ATP)
- **Mechanism**: ATP → ADP + Pi directly powers the transport
- **Main Example**: Na⁺-K⁺ ATPase (Sodium-Potassium Pump)
    - Pumps 3 Na⁺ out and 2 K⁺ in
    - Changes pump shape to push ions across membrane
		能量改变构象，翻转
- **Other Examples**:
    - H⁺-K⁺ ATPase (in stomach)
    - Ca²⁺ ATPase (in sarcoplasmic reticulum)
    - H⁺ ATPase (in lysosomes)


### 次级（继发性）主动转运 Secondary Active Transport

- **Definition**: Transport requiring binding of ≥2 different molecules/ions
					(需结合 >= 2种分子/离子)
- **Energy Source**: Still requires energy, but indirectly
    - Uses energy stored in ion concentration gradient (created by primary active transport)
    - Not passive transport because at least one molecule moves against its concentration gradient

##### Types
- （同向）协同转运 **Symport** (Co-transport)
    - Example: Na⁺-glucose transporters (SGLT)
					Na⁺ moves down its gradient (passive) while glucose moves against its gradient (active)
- 反向转运 **Antiport** (Counter-transport)
    - Example: Na⁺-Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX)
					Na⁺ moves down its gradient (passive) while Ca²⁺ is pushed against its gradient (active)
