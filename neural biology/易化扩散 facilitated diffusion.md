Movement of molecules down their concentration gradient through membrane proteins (跨膜蛋白)


**Used for**:
- Non-lipid soluble molecules (非脂溶性), e.g., Glucose
- Charged ions (带电离子), e.g., K+, Na+, Ca2+

### Channel-Mediated Facilitated Diffusion (通道易化 Channels)

- **Ion Selectivity** (离子选择性)
    - Specific permeability to certain ions

- **Channel Classification**: 
    **By What They Transport** (Channel Types):
    - Ion channels (离子通道): Selective for specific ions (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Cl-, etc.)
    - Acetylcholine receptors (乙酰胆碱受体): Specific channels for acetylcholine response
    
    **By Opening/Closing Mechanism** (Gating Properties):
    
    - Voltage-gated (电压门控): Respond to membrane potential changes → [[AP]]
    - Chemically/Ligand-gated (化学/配体门控): Open when specific molecules bind → Receptors
    - Mechanically-gated (机械门控): Respond to physical force/pressure → Membrane deformation
    - Non-gated (非门控通道): Leaking channels (always open)
    
>[!note]-  A single channel can be classified both by type and gating property
 > - Example: "Voltage-gated Na+ channel" is both an ion channel (type) and has voltage-gating (property)
 > - Example: Acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels
 >  


### Carrier-Mediated Facilitated Diffusion (载体易化 Transport)

- **Structural Specificity** (结构特异性)
    - Only binds substrates with specific chemical structures
- **Competitive Inhibition** (竞争性抑制)
    - Similar structures compete for binding sites
- **Saturation Phenomenon** (饱和现象)
    - Related to  [[Michaelis constant 米氏常数 Km]]
    - Maximum transport rate reached when all carriers are occupied
