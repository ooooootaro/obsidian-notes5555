Prefrontal cortex -- "Iron Rod Through Brain, Miraculous Survival"
	Over the past 150 years, this case has been featured in more than 500 pages of scientific papers, opening a new chapter in modern neurobiology.

The left frontal lobe "Broca's area" for language processing
	Named after French physician and anatomist
	the type of language impairment caused by damage to this region became known as "Broca's aphasia."

内侧颞叶 medial temporal lobe (the inner/medial portion of the temporal lobe)
"The Man Who Couldn't Remember": Henry Molaison (H.M.)
	He underwent bilateral (from both the left and right sides of his brain) temporal lobe surgery to treat his epilepsy. Following this procedure, he lost the ability to form new memories.
	The surgery specifically removed structures in the medial temporal lobe, including the
	- Amygdala (杏仁核)
	- Medial cortical regions (内侧皮层)
	- Hippocampus (海马)
