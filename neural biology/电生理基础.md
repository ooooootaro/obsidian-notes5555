### Graded potentials are small changes in membrane potential that:

- Vary in amplitude (can be small or large)
- Decrease in strength as they spread (decrementally conducted)
- Can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing
- Do not follow the all-or-none principle
- Include receptor potentials, electrotonic potentials, and synaptic potentials


The key distinction is that "graded potential" is a broader category that includes various types of local membrane potential changes, while [[局部电位 LP]] specifically refers to potential changes confined to particular regions of the neuron (usually synapses).
