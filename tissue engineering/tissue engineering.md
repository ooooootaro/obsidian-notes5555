### In Vitro Construction
- Utilizes biodegraded scaffold materials to inoculate cells
- Process flow:
  1. Cell expansion 
  2. Seeding cells onto scaffolds with:
     - Growth factor signals (生长信息因子)
     - Porous structured artificial extracellular matrix (多孔结构的人工细胞外基质)
  3. Bioreactor cultivation (生物反应器)
  4. Formation of tissue in external environment
  5. Implantation of engineered tissue into damaged areas

### In Vivo Construction
- Cells and scaffolds are directly implanted into the body
- Process flow:
  1. Preparation of scaffolds with:
     - Growth factor signals (生长信息因子)
     - Porous structured artificial extracellular matrix (多孔结构的人工细胞外基质)
  2. Direct implantation into damaged body area (缺损部位)
  3. Tissue regeneration and repair (组织再生与修复)
  4. Internal regeneration of functional tissue (体内方式的再生)

## Applications
- Vascular tissue engineering
- Human acellular vascular scaffolds (HAVs)
	Treatment for limb vascular injuries in trauma/battlefield situations
