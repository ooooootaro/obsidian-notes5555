### Definition

A biomaterial is any substance engineered to interact with biological systems for a medical purpose - either therapeutic (treating, augmenting, repairing, or replacing a tissue function of the body) or diagnostic.

- PMMA as "acrylic" → Not a biomaterial
    - Used in commercial products
    - No medical purpose
    - Not designed for bio-interaction
	
	**Organic Glass**
	- Highlights its transparent properties
	- Emphasizes its glass-like qualities but organic nature
	- Used often in optical applications

- PMMA as "bone cement" → IS a biomaterial
    - Specifically formulated for medical use
    - Designed to interface with bone tissue
    - Has therapeutic purpose (fixation/repair)

Boundary Considerations
Not just about the material itself
Depends on:
    - Intended use
    - Design purpose
    - Biological interaction
    - Medical application
### why
 1. Surgical Innovation: Aneurysm Treatment 动脉瘤
	**Traditional vs. Interventional Surgery 介入手术**
    - Traditional: Craniotomy (open skull surgery)
    - Interventional: Minimally invasive procedure

2. Quality of Life Improvement: Heart Valve Disease 瓣膜病
    - Initial approach: Medication therapy
    - Modern solution: Valve replacement 瓣膜置换(lasting 20+ years)
        - Addresses root cause 治本
        - Increases survival rate 生存率

3. Aesthetic Applications 美观 
	- Malformation correction (e.g., ear reconstruction)
	- Scar repair and restoration
    - Dental restoration 
    - **cosmetic dentistry 医美**

###### Corneal 角膜 Regeneration (Lancet 2024)

- **Process**:
    1. iPSC differentiation into corneal epithelial cells
    2. Cell purification and cryopreservation
    3. Tissue engineering and transplantation
- **Results**: Successful restoration of corneal function in patients



###### Manufacturing Technologies in Medical Devices

1. **Traditional Manufacturing (Subtractive)模具 减/剪裁？ **
- Based on removing material
    - Casting
    - Machining
    - Milling
    - Carving
- Limited in creating complex internal structures
- More material waste

2. **3D Printing (Additive Manufacturing) 增材制造** 
- Layer-by-layer construction
- Process flow:
    - CAD/3D Scanning
    - Slicing/Path Planning
    - Printing
    - Post-processing
- Advantages:
    - High structural complexity
    - Customization capability
    - High precision
    - Rapid production

Applications in Medical Field
1. **Orthopedic Implants**
- Common in orthopedics due to:
    - Metal biocompatibility
    - Chemical inertness
    - Mechanical strength
- Personalized fit for each patient
- Example: Custom hip replacements

2. **Artificial Lung (Correction)**
- Features:
    - Hydrogel structure
    - Air ducts with total ventilation
    - Bidirectional flow system
    - Complex internal architecture
- Materials used:
    - Biocompatible polymers
    - Hydrogels
    - Special coatings for gas exchange

###### [[Organ-on-a-Chip]] vs Artificial Organs
- **Artificial Organs/Tissues Key Differences from Organ-on-Chip**:
    - Actual transplantable biostructures
    - Uses 3D cell culture + tissue engineering
    - Requires real vascularization
    - Designed for clinical use
    - Examples: artificial skin, liver, 3D printed ear
