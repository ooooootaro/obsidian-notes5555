artificial hip joint prosthesis 
![[Pasted image 20250324151429.png]]
The main components labeled in the image are:

1. Metal outer shell (金属外臼)
2. Polymer or ceramic inner cup (聚合物或陶瓷的内臼)
3. Metal or ceramic ball (金属或陶瓷球)
4. Ceramic coating (陶瓷涂层)
5. Metal stem (金属柄)

This specific design serves several critical purposes:

1. Biomechanical function: The ball-and-socket design mimics the natural hip joint's range of motion while providing stability.
    
2. Material properties:
    
    - The metal components (stem and outer shell) provide structural strength and stability
    - The ceramic or polymer components reduce friction and wear
    - The ceramic coating improves biocompatibility and reduces corrosion

3. Modularity: Different components can be selected based on patient needs (age, activity level, bone quality)
    
4. Longevity: The materials and design aim to minimize wear particles that could lead to loosening over time
    
5. Osseointegration（ from Latin osseus "bony" and integrate "to make whole"）: The surface textures and materials are designed to promote bone growth and attachment
    

This multi-component design represents an engineering solution that balances mobility, stability, durability, and biocompatibility for long-term joint replacement success.
