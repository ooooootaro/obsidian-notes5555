Single Neuron Invasive Techniques 
- Microelectrodes: intracellular recording 
- Patch clamp technique: Gentle suction draws a piece of cell membrane into the electrode tip 
- Extracellular recording: Microelectrodes less than 10 microns are inserted into the target brain region

Two main FDA-approved electromagnetic stimulation treatments for depression are:

1. **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)** - This non-invasive procedure uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain. It was FDA-approved in 2008 for treatment-resistant depression and has several variations including:
    
    - rTMS (repetitive TMS)
    - Deep TMS
    - Theta-burst stimulation (a newer protocol)
2. **Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)** - Though older and more intensive than TMS, ECT remains one of the most effective treatments for severe depression, particularly when medications haven't worked or rapid response is needed.
    

There's also a newer option:

3. **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)** - FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression, though typically considered after other options have failed.

TMS is likely what you're thinking of, as it's become increasingly popular due to its non-invasive nature and fewer side effects compared to ECT.
