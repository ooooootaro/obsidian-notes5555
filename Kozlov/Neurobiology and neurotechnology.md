This is remarkable because it shows that in grasshopper mice (which naturally eat scorpions), the venom that normally causes pain in other animals has evolved to function as a pain blocker. The grasshopper mouse has adapted so that what would be a painful toxin to most animals actually becomes an analgesic (pain reliever).

### sum up
ACTION POTENTIAL PROPAGATION
Action potentials (APs) propagate down axons
’APs will propagate via both passive and active means
Following initiation, local cell membrane is briefly refractory
Axonal diameter and myelination influence speed of conduction
It is possible to quantitatively describe the modulation ofelectrical signals by modelling dendrites and axons as cylindersand using the cable equation (more on that at the study groups)

> [!note]- Patch-clamp recording analysis
> These images depict neuronal patch-clamp recording techniques and the resulting electrophysiological data.

> Image 1 shows a microscopic view of a neuron with labeled anatomical structures:
> - The soma (cell body) of the neuron is clearly visible as the bright central structure
> - Main apical dendrites extend from the top of the soma
> - Axons project from the bottom of the soma
> - Two patch pipettes are positioned on the neuron for simultaneous recording
> 
> The image illustrates "Simultaneous patch-clamp recording from connected neurons," which is a technique used to measure electrical activity between synaptically connected neurons.
> 
> Image 2 shows the electrophysiological data recorded from such experiments:
> - The top trace (Pre Vm) shows a presynaptic action potential
> - The red-boxed area labeled "POSTSYNAPTIC RESPONSE" shows multiple traces of postsynaptic potentials recorded following the presynaptic spike
> - Panel B shows a histogram of EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential) latencies, centered around 1.5 ms
> - Panel C shows a scatter plot of EPSP amplitude versus latency, suggesting a weak negative correlation between these parameters
> 
> This setup allows neuroscientists to directly measure synaptic transmission between neurons. When the presynaptic neuron fires (top trace), it releases neurotransmitters that cause the postsynaptic electrical responses seen in the red box. The multiple traces likely represent different trials or recordings from different cell pairs, showing the variability in synaptic responses.

>[!note] Quantal transmission-summary
Vesicular release of neurotransmitter is the foundation of quantal chemical synaptic transmission
Release is probabilistic, synapse specific, and dynamic
Postsynaptic action is ultimately dependent on channel opening and thus can be deterministically modelled in similar ways to other channel conductances
The small values of P and N for individual cortical synapses mean that stochastic models may be more accurately capture properties of cortical neurotransmission
