A strength-duration curve (also called a strength-duration relationship) is a fundamental concept in neurophysiology and electrophysiology that describes the relationship between the intensity (strength) of an electrical stimulus and its duration (pulse width) required to reach threshold for exciting a nerve or muscle.

The key features of a strength-duration curve include:

1. **Threshold relationship**: It shows the minimum amount of electrical current needed to trigger an action potential (nerve impulse) at different stimulus durations.
    
2. **Inverse relationship**: As stimulus duration increases, the threshold current intensity decreases. This means shorter pulses require higher current amplitudes to activate the tissue.
    
3. **Rheobase**: The minimum current required to stimulate a nerve with an infinitely long stimulus duration (or practically, a very long pulse). This forms the horizontal asymptote of the curve.
    
4. **Chronaxie**: The stimulus duration required to excite a nerve when using twice the rheobase current. This is a measure of tissue excitability and represents a time constant characteristic of the tissue.
    

Strength-duration curves are clinically important for:

- Diagnosing neuromuscular disorders
- Designing effective electrical stimulation protocols
- Characterizing different types of nerve fibers
- Optimizing parameters for neurostimulation devices (pacemakers, deep brain stimulators, etc.)

Different types of nerves and muscles have characteristic strength-duration curves that reflect their membrane properties and excitability characteristics.
