- Repeated stimulation of the same synapse alters release probability
- Timescale: from milliseconds to tens of seconds
- Polarity and scale of history-dependence is synapse-specific

### presynaptic
##### depression 释放少
depletion of docked vesicles

replenish

##### facilitation
elevated [Ca 2+]

a specific protein bind it

the buffer got saturated and no longer bind Ca 2+


### postsynaptic 接受少
##### desensitization
desensitized state
sodium channel has inactive state: abs reflective period

##### saturation receptor是有限的
