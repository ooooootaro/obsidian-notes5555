Integrate-fire models fail to capture the complexity of single neuron computation in several ways:

- Passive cable properties of neuronal dendrites profoundly attenuate incoming synaptic signals
- Non-linear active dendritic conductance provide a bidirectional pathway for communication between synapse and cell body
- Clustered input can produce supra-linear summation via NMDA-spikes
- Effective modelling of single neuron computation requires morphologically accurate multi-compartment modelling

### problem

1: Passive attenuation of synaptic inputs via dendrites
- "Most synapses arrive on the neuronal dendrites
- Propagation from dendrite to soma is subject passive cable attenuation

2: sublinear EPSP summation in passive dendrites
