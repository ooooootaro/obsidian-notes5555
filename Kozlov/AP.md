IONIC BASIS OF ACTION POTENTIALGENERATION
.Depolarisation ofthe cell membrane activates a large inward voltage-dependent Natcurrent
2.Membrane potential rapidly depolarises above 0 mV (Vm -> ENa+)
3.Voltage-dependent K+ currents activate, Na+ current inactivates rapidly repolarisingmembrane potential
4.Membrane repolarisation de-inactiygtes Na+ currents, permitting repetitive firing
5.Time-course of de-inactivation enforces absolute refractory period, when neuron isnot excitable
Hodgkin and Huxley formalised our understanding of cellular electricity in terms oftransient changes in ionic currents (conductances)

ROLE OF ION CHANNELS IN ACTIONPOTENTIAL GENERATION
lndividual channels are either OPEN or CLOSED (and gate stochastically)Open probability and single channel conductance are key properties
Membranes typically have large numbers of channels
