Yes, electron microscopy can be used to study brain tissue, but it cannot be used to study the living brain in real time. Here's why:

Electron microscopy provides extremely high-resolution images by using a beam of electrons rather than light, allowing scientists to visualize cellular structures at nanometer scales. However, it has significant limitations for studying living tissue:

1. Sample preparation requirements: Electron microscopy requires specimens to be:
    
    - Fixed with chemicals
    - Dehydrated
    - Embedded in resin
    - Cut into ultrathin sections
    - Stained with heavy metals
2. Vacuum environment: Electron microscopes operate in a high vacuum, which is incompatible with living tissue.
    
3. Electron beam damage: The electron beam itself would damage living cells.
    

Instead, researchers study the brain using electron microscopy through several approaches:

- Post-mortem tissue analysis
- Biopsy samples
- Rapid freezing techniques (cryo-electron microscopy)
- Correlative approaches that combine other live imaging with subsequent electron microscopy

For studying the living brain in action, other techniques are used:

- Functional MRI (fMRI)
- Electroencephalography (EEG)
- Two-photon microscopy
- Optogenetics

Electron microscopy remains invaluable for understanding the brain's ultrastructure, revealing details about synapses, organelles, and cellular connections that other methods cannot visualize.
