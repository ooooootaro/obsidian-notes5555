Yes, human hemoglobin exists in four main forms:

1. **Hemoglobin A (HbA)** - The most common type in adults, making up about 97% of adult hemoglobin
    
2. **Hemoglobin A2 (HbA2)** - A minor component of adult hemoglobin (about 2-3%)
    
3. **Hemoglobin F (HbF)** - Fetal hemoglobin, predominant in fetuses and newborns, with higher oxygen affinity than adult hemoglobin
    
4. **Hemoglobin S (HbS)** - An abnormal form associated with sickle cell disease, resulting from a genetic mutation
    

Additionally, each hemoglobin molecule consists of four protein subunits (two alpha and two beta chains in HbA), and each subunit contains a heme group that can bind to oxygen. This tetrameric structure allows hemoglobin to bind up to four oxygen molecules.
