The highlighted 50Hz notch filter (50Hz陷波器) with >20dB attenuation

The notch filter is a key component in biomedical instrumentation as it selectively removes the 50Hz component from the signal while preserving the physiological information in the bioelectric signal. The ">20dB" annotation indicates that the filter attenuates the 50Hz interference by more than 20 decibels.
